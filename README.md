-> Based on the scatter plot from the K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, here are the key insights:

THE SILHOUTTE SCORE OF THIS PARTICULAR CLUSTERING MODEL IS OPTIMUM(~0.45)

1.Clusters and Spending Patterns:

1.1) Red Cluster (top right): Customers in this cluster have a high annual income but relatively low spending scores. This could indicate wealthier customers who are cautious with their spending.

1.2) Purple Cluster (top left): Customers with a low annual income and high spending score. These customers may prioritize spending despite having a lower income, indicating a potential "budget-conscious spender" group.

1.3) Green Cluster (center): This group consists of customers with moderate income and spending scores, representing an average spending pattern.

1.4) Blue Cluster (bottom left): Customers with low income and low spending scores, representing a "low-income, low-spending" group.

1.5) Yellow Cluster (bottom right): High-income customers with low spending scores, suggesting high-income but conservative spending behavior.


2.Centroids:

->The black dots in each cluster represent the cluster centroids, indicating the average spending score and annual income for each segment. These centroids help define the typical behavior of customers within each group.


3.Business Implications:

Target High Spenders: The purple and green cluster represents high-spending customers regardless of income, making them valuable for targeted promotions or premium product offerings.

Upsell Opportunities: For the green cluster, which has moderate spending and income, consider strategies to encourage spending, as they have the potential to increase their engagement.

Low-Spending High-Income Customers: For the yellow and red clusters, marketing strategies could be tailored to boost spending, perhaps by introducing luxury items or rewards programs to match their income level.
